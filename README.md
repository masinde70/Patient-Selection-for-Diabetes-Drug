This project will demonstrate the importance of building the right data representation at the encounter level, with appropriate filtering and preprocessing/feature engineering of key medical code sets. we analyze and interpret the model for biases across key demographic groups. Lastly, we will utilize the TF probability library to provide uncertainty range estimates in the regression output predictions to prioritize and triage prediction uncertainty levels.
